            <p class="aboutmeparagraph">Hello, my name is Joseph Watson. I am a computer science student at UNC Charlotte with a passion for building software that not only works well behind the scenes but also looks polished on the surface. I enjoy the problem-solving side of backend logic, but I also like bringing things to life visually and making sure the end result feels smooth, presentable, and intuitive.</p>
            <p class="aboutmeparagraph">Through coursework and personal projects, I have worked with topics such as data structures, web development, and software design. I am always looking to learn something new and find better ways to turn an idea into a working, user-friendly product.</p>
            <p class="aboutmeparagraph">Outside of computer science, I enjoy playing soccer, working out, and allowing myself to grow as a professional developer. This website is where I share my work, ideas, and overall professional growth.</p>
            <p class="aboutmeparagraph">Thank you for stopping by, please reach out if you are interested in connecting.</p>
